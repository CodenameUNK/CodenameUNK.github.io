My name is Urijah Key. My birthday is December 3, 1997. I was born in Hattiesburg, MS and lived there for quite some time. I currently reside in Shaw, MS. During my high school career, I participated many different activities. I was the goalie for my soccer team, sports announcer on Piney 104.3, honor student, choir member, student ambassador, and a Jr. MANRRS member. Ending my senior year, I graduated in the top ten of my class. I was number 8.
